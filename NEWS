                   GNU Image Manipulation Program
                         Development Branch
                   ------------------------------

This is the development branch of GIMP.


Overview of Changes from GIMP 3.0.2 to GIMP 3.0.4
=================================================

Graphical User Interface:

  - Highlight selected device in GimpDeviceStatus.

Plug-ins:

  - Restore GUI to Difference Clouds script. This had been lost since
    GIMP 2.8!

Build:

  - Make Windows installer aware of Install, Reinstall and Update modes.
  - Add Repair mode to Windows installer: in particular we can now fix
    installations when the previous install directory cannot be
    accessed anymore.
  - The feature to delete the config folder on Windows uninstall will
    now make a backup on the Desktop first (allowing people to delete it
    themselves, move it, or even restore it later if needed).
  - Our AppImage won't ship debug symbols anymore. Better debugging can
    be set with: export DEBUGINFOD_URLS="https://debuginfod.debian.net"


Overview of Changes from GIMP 3.0.0 to GIMP 3.0.2
=================================================

This is a bug-fix only release.

Core:

  - Mark some strings translatable.
  - Fix crash when choosing a brush in grid view.
  - Windows: temporary revert of some Input Device handling code which
    was breaking pressure sensitivity for some graphics tablets (though
    this revert may make issues with the eraser tip).
  - Fix crash when choosing a non-existing font in text tool options.

Tools:

  - Reorder Line Art Detection options per design decision.

Graphical User Interface:

  - Keep headerbar color consistent when out of focus.
  - Histogram uses the luminance value of the foreground color as a
    threshold to lighten or darken the border color for contrast with
    the histogram itself.
  - Improve separation between panels in dark theme.
  - Add default response for GimpQueryBox dialogues.
  - Spacing between toolbox widgets improved.
  - GimpSpinScale slider colors inverted.
  - New icons: "gimp-toggle-on" and "gimp-toggle-off" and using them in
    the Search Action's list as icons for toggle actions.

Plug-ins:

  - Python Console uses the luminance of the background color for error
    text.
  - Metadata Editor: fix buffer overflow.
  - Gradient Flare: fix crash when setting the size to 0.
  - Screenshot: X11 implementation is bypassed (in favor of portals)
    when running on XWayland.

Build:

  - Various packaging fixes and cleanup.
  - The Windows installer now prompts (only in user installation) about
    deleting GIMP config files when uninstalling.
  - GEGL 0.4.58 is now our minimum requirement.
  - Windows installer: create Restore Point on system-wide install.
