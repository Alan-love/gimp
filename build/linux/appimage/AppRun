## Minimum runtime paths
export PATH="$APPDIR"/usr/bin/:"$PATH"
unset LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export XDG_DATA_DIRS="$APPDIR"/usr/share/:"$XDG_DATA_DIRS"


## Other needed runtime paths (added by 3_dist-gimp-goappimage.sh)
### FIXME: We need to run on squash-fs dir since LD is hardlinked into executables
cd "$APPDIR"
